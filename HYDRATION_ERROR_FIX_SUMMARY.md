# Hydration Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing React hydration errors due to mismatches between server-rendered HTML and client-side rendered content. The main causes were:

1. **Dark mode state mismatch**: The `@fisch0920/use-dark-mode` library was modifying DOM during initialization
2. **BodyClassName component**: Conditional rendering based on client-only state (`mounted` and `isDarkMode`)
3. **Formula injection script**: Modifying DOM too early during hydration
4. **Direct DOM manipulation**: Various components modifying `document.body.classList` during render

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Safe Dark Mode Hook (`/lib/use-dark-mode-safe.ts`)
- Wraps the original `use-dark-mode` library to prevent SSR issues
- Lazy loads the dark mode implementation only on client side
- Returns safe default values during SSR
- Ensures React hook rules are followed (no conditional hook calls)

### 2. Updated Dark Mode Usage in Components
- Replaced all `useDarkMode` imports with `useDarkModeSafe`
- Updated components:
  - `/components/NotionPage.tsx`
  - `/components/Header.tsx`
  - `/components/Footer.tsx`
  - `/components/NotionPageHeader.tsx`

### 3. Removed BodyClassName Component Usage
- Removed conditional rendering of `BodyClassName` components
- Moved all body class modifications to `useEffect` hooks
- Ensures no DOM modifications happen during SSR or initial render

### 4. Fixed Body Class Management in NotionPage
- Added comprehensive `useEffect` to handle all body classes after mount:
  - `no-notion-tabs`
  - `dark-mode` (based on dark mode state)
  - `notion-lite` (for lite mode)
- Proper cleanup on unmount

### 5. Delayed Formula Injection Script
- Modified script loading in `_document.tsx` to use custom loading logic
- Script now loads after window load event with additional delay
- Increased delay in the script itself from 3s to 5s to ensure hydration completion

## Key Changes Summary

1. **No DOM modifications during render**: All DOM updates moved to `useEffect`
2. **Consistent SSR/CSR behavior**: Safe wrapper ensures same output on server and client
3. **Proper timing**: Scripts and DOM modifications delayed until after hydration
4. **React rules compliance**: No conditional hook calls

## Testing
After these changes, the application should no longer show hydration errors in the console. The dark mode toggle, body classes, and formula injection should all work correctly without causing mismatches between server and client rendering.
